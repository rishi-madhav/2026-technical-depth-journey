# Supply Chain Risk Intelligence MCP Server

## Overview
MCP server that enables AI assistants to query supply chain knowledge graphs for risk analysis, alternative supplier identification, and impact assessment.

**Status:** In Development (Week 1/4)

## Business Value
- Reduces supply chain risk analysis from hours to seconds
- Enables natural language queries on complex graph data
- Provides GSI partners with reference implementation
- Demonstrates RapidMiner Graph Studio + AI integration

## Technical Architecture
[Will add architecture diagram in Week 4]

**Components:**
- RapidMiner Graph Studio (knowledge graph database)
- Python MCP Server (tool provider)
- Claude Desktop (AI assistant client)

## Knowledge Graph Schema
[Will add after designing in Week 1]

## MCP Tools (5 planned)
1. `supply_chain_impact` - Analyze impact of supplier disruptions
2. `find_alternatives` - Identify alternative suppliers
3. `risk_assessment` - Generate risk scores and reports
4. `dependency_map` - Visualize supply chain dependencies
5. `generate_report` - Create formatted risk reports

## Setup Guide
[Will add in Week 2]

## Usage Examples
[Will add in Week 3]

## Partner Enablement
[Will add in Week 4]

Starting a focused technical depth journey in 2025.

First goal: Build an MCP server for supply chain risk intelligence on knowledge graphs. This will help our GSI partners integrate AI with RapidMiner Graph Studio.

Following the "uncomfortable path" - building production systems that create value, not collecting certificates.

Documenting the entire journey publicly. Let's see where this goes.
