# 2026-technical-depth-journey
Building technical depth through production projects: AWS Solutions Architect certification, MCP servers, GraphRAG implementation, and AI-powered tools. Following the uncomfortable path of shipping over consuming.

## Goals

### Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar): Foundation
- **AWS Solutions Architect Associate** certification
- **Production MCP Server** deployed
- **Weekly documentation** habit established
- **GitHub portfolio** started

### Q2 2026 (Apr-Jun): ML/AI Depth
- Complete Fast.ai Practical Deep Learning
- Implement GraphRAG on knowledge graphs
- Build 3 vibe-coded ML/AI tools
- Deliver internal tech talk

### Q3 2026 (Jul-Sep): Scale & Position
- Scale GraphRAG to production with metrics
- Apply to executive education programs
- Build open source tool with users
- Secure technical advisory role

### Q4 2026 (Oct-Dec): Portfolio & Visibility
- Complete third major project
- Launch technical portfolio website
- Deliver conference/meetup talk
- Active conversations with executive recruiters

## Principles

1. **Build over consume** - Ship working code, not just course completions
2. **Document everything** - Weekly progress updates, no exceptions
3. **External validation** - Seek proof that work has value
4. **Vibe coding** - Use AI tools aggressively to ship faster
5. **No course browsing** - Stick to the plan, resist distractions

## Weekly Commitment
- 6 hours: Study/Learn
- 3 hours: Build
- 1 hour: Document
